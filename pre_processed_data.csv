evaluation of   tcm technegas ventilation scintigraphy in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism   in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism  perfusion lung scintigraphy offers high sensitivity but low specificity   the specificity can be significantly increased by the use of combined ventilation and perfusion studies   most aspects of perfusion lung scintigraphy are uniformly accepted but the technique of ventilation imaging varies from centre to centre   this study describes a new technique for the performance of ventilation scintigraphy using a suspension of ultrafine carbon particles labelled with   tcm   technegas     the technique combines the ready availability of   tcm and its optimal imaging properties with an easily administered radiopharmaceutical of particle size sufficiently small to deposit in the alveoli   of    patients studied by conventional perfusion scintigraphy plus technegas ventilation scintigraphy  images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all      of these patients also had a ventilation study using   krm gas and in only one instance did the two methods of ventilation imaging lead to differing interpretations   we conclude that high quality diagnostic images may be obtained using this new technique  which can be made available on both a routine and an emergency basis  thus improving the service provided for patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism  ,C08
cardiorespiratory effects of pressure controlled ventilation in severe respiratory failure   cardiorespiratory values were measured in ten patients with severe respiratory failure on volume controlled and pressure controlled ventilation   tidal volume  respirator rate  peep  auto peep  inspiratory expiratory ratio       and fio  were maintained at the same value for both ventilatory modalities   changing from vcv to pcv was associated with significant improvements in pao   oxygen delivery  and tissue oxygen consumption   peak inspiratory pressure fell   there were no significant changes in other cardiorespiratory values  such as arterial blood pressure  nor in ventilatory measurements  such as mean airway pressure  associated with the use of pcv   these results suggest that pcv may be a beneficial ventilatory modality in the treatment of severe respiratory failure since it results in improvement in arterial oxygenation  tissue oxygen delivery and utilization without any concomitant adverse effects on other hemodynamic or ventilatory factors  ,C08
lung function in school age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood   we examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness  lri  experienced in early childhood and lung function in    boys and    girls   to    yr of age   the children s histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing lri during the first   yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice   most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the   yr prior to lung function testing   in sex specific analyses  average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing lri during the preschool years   boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing lri during the preschool years had lower average fev   fev  fvc  fef       vmax    and vmax   than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness   the association between recurrent preschool wheezing lri and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the   yr prior to study   girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing lri had lower average fef      and vmax   than girls with a history of zero or one such illness  but differences were not statistically significant   recurrent nonwheezing lri during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex  regardless of preschool wheezing lri history   detailed information concerning early childhood lri experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children  ,C08
gastrointestinal disease and oral contraception   oral contraceptive steroids play a major role in modern family planning   with the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens  any factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower dose preparations may have an impact on contraceptive protection   although ethinyl estradiol  the most commonly used oral estrogen  is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as unchanged drug  the commonly used progestogens are not   at present  no convincing evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the pill   oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel  and contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity   enhanced passage of gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease  diarrhea  ileostomy  or jejunoileal bypass  ,C06
fat saturation mr imaging of the upper abdomen   the fat saturation  fatsat  mr technique decreases the signal intensity of fat  thereby enhancing the definition of upper abdominal organs and reducing artifacts while maintaining the t  and t  information available on spin echo sequences   to evaluate the potential of fatsat in examining the abdomen  we conducted a prospective study involving    subjects  including four normal volunteers     patients investigated for liver disease  and eight patients studied for miscellaneous abdominal disease   short tr                 tr te   and long tr                          spin echo images with and without fatsat were compared   the images were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively   qualitative assessment was made with receiver operating characteristic  roc  curve analysis of the confidence level of observers to detect the presence of disease  comparing fatsat with standard spin echo sequences   roc analysis showed greater interpreter confidence and accuracy for fatsat sequences than for standard spin echo sequences   the measured signal difference to noise  sd n  ratio comparing upper abdominal organs with surrounding tissue revealed the highest values for short tr te regular spin echo  followed by short tr te fatsat   the highest sd n ratio for hepatic masses was with long tr te fatsat followed by short tr te fatsat   the results of this study suggest that the fatsat technique may improve abdominal mr imaging  ,C06
primary resection and anastomosis in obstructed descending colon due to cancer   intraoperative colonic irrigation followed by one stage resection is gaining popularity as the optimal surgical treatment for left sided colonic obstruction   however  its efficacy and potential hazards have not been adequately tested in obstruction due to colonic cancer   we analyzed the early results of    consecutive patients with obstructive left sided colonic carcinoma treated by primary resection and anastomosis following intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage   two patients        died  one from complication of anastomotic leakage   the significant postoperative complications were chest infection in three       and wound infection in seven           the average hospital stay was      days   the results of this study suggest that intraoperative bowel irrigation permits one stage resection and anastomosis to be conducted with reasonable safety provided care is taken in operative techniques  ,C06
